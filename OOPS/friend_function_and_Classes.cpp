// Following are some important points about friend functions and classes:
// 1) Friends should be used only for limited purpose. too many functions or external classes are declared as friends of a class with protected or private data, it lessens the value of encapsulation of separate classes in object-oriented programming.
// 2) Friendship is not mutual. If class A is a friend of B, then B doesnâ€™t become a friend of A automatically.
// 3) Friendship is not inherited
// 4) The concept of friends is not there in Java.


//friend Function
//Friend Function Like friend class, a friend function can be given special grant to access private and protected members. A friend function can be:
// a) A method of another class
// b) A global function

//this is required because compiler needs to know there will be a class of name B which would be used in a friend function in class A
class B;

class A{
  private:
    int number1,number2;
    //doesnt matter at all where we declare the function as friend ,can do it in private , public or protected class area
    //friend function that can access private , protected and public members of this class A

//Friend Classes
//A friend class can access private and protected members of other class in which it is declared as friend

//forward declaration
class Y;
//might also work without it depends on compiler
